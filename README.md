Open Discussion and Ideas

Hi my name is Dawn and I am working hard to learn to code.
I already have a fair understanding of HMTL and CSS. I plan to move on to JavaScript next.
Before moving on, I am commited to completed a few webpages for myself.
After I would like to start making income building sites and then expanding my skills and knowledge.
Please feel free to comment or simply watch my journey.
